      <p class="abstract">The fundamental frequency of the human voice is an
      essential feature for various speech processing tasks such as speech
      recognition, speaker identification, and speech compression. Therefore, a
      large number of fundamental frequency estimation algorithms have been
      developed. To evaluate the performance of these algorithms, their
      estimates are often compared against a known ground truth fundamental
      frequency, typically derived from laryngograph recordings. However,
      laryngograph recordings are not available for all kinds of speech corpora,
      and can be tonal where the acoustic speech signal is not. Alternatively,
      fundamental frequency estimates of speech in noise are compared against
      clean speech estimates of a reference algorithm. While this works for
      arbitrary speech recordings, it is highly dependent on the reference
      algorithm. We therefore propose a new method for deriving a fundmental
      frequency ground truth from the consensus of a number of state-of-the-art
      fundamental frequency estimation algorithms, which can be calculated for
      any speech corpus, is more robust than a single algorithm's estimate, and
      which better reflects the acoustic tonality of speech.</p>

      <p>
        This website contains the consensus ground truth for the following five
        speech corpora:
        <ul>
          <li>FDA: import script, consensus truth, corpus dataset</li>
          <li>KEELE: import script, consensus truth, corpus dataset</li>
          <li>PTDB-TUG: import script, consensus truth, corpus dataset</li>
          <li>TIMIT: import script, consensus truth</li>
          <li>MOCHA-TIMIT: import script, consensus truth, corpus dataset</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these corpora save their data in different formats. This website
        additionally contains import scripts that convert each of these corpora
        into a common, human-readable and machine-readable format: JBOF datasets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Source code for reading these datasets is provided under a free license
        on Github.
      </p>
      <p>
        No complete dataset can be provided for the TIMIT corpus, since its
        license does not allow for it.
